# CustomDNDSheets
This is a project for playing your homebrew custom DND campaings. It is still under development, you can't really play with it right now but it will get there in no time.

## Technologies
I used .NET Core API as backend, Angular 10 as frontend and PostgreSQL for database

## Docker
There is no docker support right now, I'll have it dockerize and make it one container both client side and server side.

## How to start
You can start both manuelly unfortunatly, I'll dockerize this in future.
ng serve for Agnular, dotnet start for backend side.
